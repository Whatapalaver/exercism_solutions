Exercism.io
======
[Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) provides excellent challenge material with support for multiple languages.  
I have started following these to supplement my experience at Makers bootcamp. I use it mostly for morning practice to try and develop some core language skills and confidence. 

Some set-up required:

- install exercism `brew update && brew install exercism`
- install test dependencies eg minitest for ruby `gem install minitest`
- [setup your CLI](https://exercism.io/cli-walkthrough) and edit config if you want to change location

To submit:

`exercism submit ./path/to/file`
